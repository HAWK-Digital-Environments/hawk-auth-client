# HAWK - Auth Client (PHP)

This library is designed as wrapper around the Keycloak REST API (using
the [hawk-keycloak-auth-server](https://github.com/HAWK-Digital-Environments/hawk-keycloak-auth-server) for additional
features).
The premise of the package is to provide a convenient way to build microservices with secure authentication and
authorization.
